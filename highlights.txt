Rewiring is applied to the network of evolutionary Dictator Game agent populations.

Rewiring occurs according to the trust weights of the agents.

Over generations, agents update their trust in others and then evolve by imitating the strategies of others.

The trust weight rewiring system can promote fairness depending on the evolution rate and rewire probability parameters.
